                <p class="frogtext"><br>Is a very fun way to learn CSS selectors and HTML mark-up language the aim of the game is to get the Frogs onto the Lilly pads by instructing them with code. This is great for beginners to learn another style of position and has helped me a lot in my knowledge of CSS. Why don’t you have a go http://flexboxfroggy.com/.<br></p>
                <p class="codetext"><br>Ok I’ll admit it I find myself looking at this website all the time! It’s a great way of getting inspiration from other developers in their projects. The website mainly focuses on Front-End Development and lets the user use HTML and CSS and Javascript for writing code. It’s a great website to create a portfolio of your work. <br></p>
                <p class="cadtext"><br>This is mainly been where I have learnt HTML and CSS and I could not recommend it enough. What I really like about the site is when you start a section it gives you an intro to what you will be learning then give you instructions to complete the task once you complete a section you get badges. I have a notebook full of notes taken from CodCademy as it’s a great learning experience.<br></p>
                <p class="frontendtext"><br>This has been my bible in the last couple of months. This is packed full of information that has helped me understand the world of Web Design. It has useful links to websites to learn such as CodeCademy and also tells you what you need to know to become a Front-End Developer. I really like the Salaries part of the book especially when the average wage in the us is $75K (That’s motivation or what!)<br></p>
