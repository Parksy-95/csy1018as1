                <p class="mktext"><br>Good – I really liked the navigation bar on this Website I think that colour of grey work really well.<br> 

                  <br>Bad- On some pages the picture quality is not the best compared to the overall website quality.<br>
                  
                  <br>Improve- To improve this website I think they should have used video as a GIF of an ice hockey match on the man home page.<br></p>
                <img class="redbull" src="style/screenshots/Redbull.jpg" alt="Redbull Website">
                <p class="redbulltext"><br>Good- The way this website is very interactive is perfect for a user wanting to know more about the purpose of this website is.<br>

                  <br>Bad- Every time you go onto this website sound atomically play which is fine. The sound it plays is very eerie and not overall great.<br>
                  
                  <br>Improve- I would use F1 sounds when you navigate through the pages and change the music which plays when you go onto this website.<br>

                  <img class="BearGrylls" src="style/screenshots/BearGrylls.jpg" alt="Bear Grylls Website">
                  <p class="BearGryllstext"><br>Good – The pictures on this website are amazing. The quality and the way the text blends in with the text is very effective.<br>

                    <br>Bad- The newsletter sign up icon kept popping up even though I closed it 2-3 times.<br>
                    
                    <br>Improve- Only thing I would improve is on the Navigation bar there is a red line that goes through pages you hover over and which I would choose not to have.<br>

                  <img class="AudiR8" src="style/screenshots/AudiR8.jpg" alt="AudiR8 Website">
                  <p class="Auditext"><br>Good – I focused on the Audi R8 on the Audi website as I really like how to colour red is used as the background and the way the car stands out against it even though that’s read as well.<br>

                    <br>Bad- I didn’t like how they used 2D image. Audi should have gone with a 3D picture which you can turn the model of the car around to see a 360-degree view.<br>
                    
                    <br>Improve- Add a video on the website either an external link of what it’s like to drive the car.<br>
