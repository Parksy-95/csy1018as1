    <p class="p1"> My name is Mathew Parks. I am 22 years old and live in Milton Keynes. I am currently studying Business Systems at the University of Northampton. 
      As a child, I used to go fishing with my Dad and this has turned into one of my biggest hobbies. This has led me to many different lakes/rivers in England and even canals in Spain catching all different species of fish. 
      I am a massive follower of English ice Hockey and follow my team MK Lightning all the time. If you ever need to find me on a Saturday night, check Planet Ice Milton Keynes. Last season we secured a 2nd place league finish in the English Premier League. Won our first EPL cup beating Peterborough Phantoms on a tense Penalty Shootout and then beat Telford Tigers 7-2 in Coventry to win the Playoff Title so as you can tell it was a crazy season to be a Lightning fan. 
      Once I finish university and get my degree I want to put my skills into use in industry for a big Tech company and then start my own business designing web sites.</p>

I am a huge petrol head with a massive obsession for cars and motorbikes, i drive a Nissan 350z and ride a KTM SMR 450, you can see them on the left. When i get the opportunity i like to go drifting and hit the track on my bike, If you dont know what drifting is, check out the video. I try and stay as fit as possible, until september hits and then its Christmas and i can eat what i want :), 
        I have trained in mixed martial arts since the age of 18 and i am always trying to be active in the gym. My goal at the end of this course is to launch my own company so i can work for myself and live for me!</p>
