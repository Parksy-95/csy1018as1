              <h2>Web Developer</h2>
              <p>Through the use of code, such as HTML or JavaScript, web developers bring a website or web application to life. Continued testing, maintenance, and updates are handled by the web developer throughout the lifecycle of the website.
                  The role of a Web Developer is to build and shape a website from instructions from a project manager, Web Designer or their own clients. The final product will be based from the information given by the client from budget, scope and design.  
                  Through the use of code such as HTML/CSS/Javascript Web Developers bring a website to life from the design plans and wireframes. As the world of websites are changing all the time maintenance and updates are required throughout the course of the lifecycle of the product. Building a web page is a creation of page layouts, styling of colours and fonts and page features including pictures and videos.

              <h2>Web Designer</h2>
              <p>Two jobs one outcome.
                  
                  What is the difference between a Web Designer and a Web Developer? A Web Designer role is not to write code but to create a look for the web. The design is then married with code and brought to life. The Web Designer uses graphics and graphic design to create a look for the web. 
                  Development has finished with the code. Designers collect their previous work either for the company or to show potential clients to win business. 
                  
                  One of the toughest parts of building a website is communication in the team. There is a lot of terminology used and can be hard to understand. For example, the Web Designer but not understand the code used and communication can breakdown. Keeping jargon down in meetings so both parties are happy can benefit the end product.

              <h2>Google Office's</h2>
              <p>One thing I have noticed when looking through these job roles is what packages a company can offer. Google has set the bar in terms of the office environment and how creative the building is. To get the best engineers and developers to for work them and not the competitors Google offices are second to none. From pool table, sleep pods, on site gyms to breakout areas to work in. Free food to have in the snack bars or free coffee shops on site and they even offer free breakfast, lunch and dinner in one of their many restaurants in the building. As the standard is set very high IT professionals are now looking for more than just a conventional grey office environment. Companies like Dropbox, Airbnb, Pinterest and Twitter are now updating their own office environment to create competition for Google. </p>
