                    <br>I worked in recruitment for 5 years before I started this course. I had the worse day of my life that day and decided to take the plunged and go and apply at Northampton University. I have not regretted it since. It has opened up so much opportunity for me and opened my eyes to a whole new world.<br>

                    <br>I am still shocked that I can build a basic website and I have only been doing this course since October 2017. With the resources, out there learning is not just reading from a textbook it’s an experience. I cannot recommend CodeCademy enough as this has taught me so much and feel this is so much more to learn and I will always be learning new standards of web design.<br>
                    
                    <br>I wasn’t too sure on what I wanted to do after I graduated in 3 years’ time but since doing web development I want to pursue this as a career and this is going to sound cringe but “fallen in love with it”. The opportunities out there you can take are amazing. Working with new talented people is not only good for the work but also good for my development.<br>
                    
                    <br>I’m not going to lie and said it was easy learning HTML and CSS and I found myself looking at advice from developers as I couldn’t get myself into it. Most of them said it keep practicing code and it will just click. I thought this was very strange until 2 months ago and guess what It clicked... 
                     
                    <br>I work now part time as a tutor for a company called GoCode Academy based in Milton Keynes and what they do is teach children how to code and program. We use programs such a scratch and microbits and CS First to help them with their journey and the children love it. I have seen Children with no knowledge of computers to finish at the end of the camp showing their parents a game they have made which is full functionally and great for the user.<br>
